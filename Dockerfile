# Two ways in, selected by the `binaries` build context:
#
#   prebuilt — the CI job already compiled the release binaries and passes them
#              in. It builds inside this same `rust:bookworm` image, so the
#              glibc the binaries link against matches the runtime stage. That
#              skips a second full compile of the workspace.
#
#   builder  — nothing was passed in (a local `docker build`, or CI without the
#              artifact). Compiles from source, as before.
#
# Select with `--build-arg BINARIES=prebuilt`. Default is a self-contained build.
